The PDPC is organising briefing sessions to provide an overview on how the PDPA applies when organisations collect, use and disclose NRIC and other national identification numbers. Each session will also include the resources available to help organisations implement changes to their policies and processes, and conclude with a Q&A session where organisations may seek clarifications on the Advisory Guidelines.

Registration for the briefing sessions has been closed. Thank you.
