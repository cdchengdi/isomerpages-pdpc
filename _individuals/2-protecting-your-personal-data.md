With the pervasiveness of technology, it is important to ensure your personal data is used the way you want it to be.

Here are some tips for you:

##### **In general**

* Always think about who you are giving your personal data to and why. If it is not clear why your personal data is needed, always ask.
* Be cautious about providing any personal detail to unsolicited callers by phone, fax, post, or email, unless you are able to confirm the authenticity of the call.
* Shred or destroy all documents containing any personal details before throwing them away.
