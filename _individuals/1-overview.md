Your personal data is important and you have a role to play in protecting your personal data. With the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA), you will have more control over how your personal data is collected, used and disclosed. You also have rights of access and correction in relation to your personal data. This means that you may request any organisation which possesses your personal data to give you access to and amend your data as and when you find it necessary.

The Do Not Call (DNC) Registry will also allow you to opt out of unsolicited marketing calls, messages and faxes.

### **What you need to know about the PDPA's data protection rules:**

##### **Collection, Use and Disclosure**
* For personal data that organisations collect before the personal data protection provisions come into effect, organisations may continue to use such personal data for the purposes for which it was collected unless you inform the organisations that you do not consent to their use of your personal data.

* For personal data that organisations collect after the personal data protection provisions come into effect, organisations have to get your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data. To obtain your consent, the organisations should inform you of the purpose(s) for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal data. Feel free to ask the organisations to provide the contact of a person who can answer, on behalf of the organisation, your questions about the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data.

* Organisations should not, as a condition of supplying a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data beyond what is reasonable to provide that product or service to you.

* If you voluntarily provide your personal data to an organisation for a purpose, you may be deemed to have consented to the use of your personal data for that specific purpose.

* You may withdraw your consent for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal data by an organisation at any time, with reasonable notice. The organisation should inform you of the likely consequences of your withdrawal, and cease collecting, using or disclosing your personal data.
