The Do Not Call (DNC) Registry lets you opt out of marketing messages addressed to your Singapore telephone number, such as those which promote or advertise a good or service, allowing you to have more control over the kind of messages you receive on your telephone, mobile phone or fax machine.

The DNC regime under the PDPA prohibits organisations from sending such messages to Singapore telephone numbers, including mobile, fixed-line, residential and business numbers, registered with the registry. 

Organisations which have an ongoing relationship with a subscriber or user of a Singapore telephone number may send marketing messages on similar or related products, services and memberships to that Singapore telephone number via text or fax without checking against the DNC Registry. Each exempt message must also contain an opt-out facility that you may use to opt out from receiving such telemarketing messages. If you opt out, organisations can no longer rely on the exemption and must stop sending such messages to your Singapore telephone number after 30 days.
