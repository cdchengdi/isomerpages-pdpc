> The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) was established on 2 January 2013 to administer and enforce the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA).

### **Our Mission**
To promote and enforce personal data protection so as to foster an environment of trust among businesses and consumers, contributing to a vibrant Singapore economy.

### **Our Functions**
The PDPC serves as Singapore’s main authority in matters relating to personal data protection and will represent the Singapore Government internationally on data protection related issues.

In administering and enforcing the PDPA, the PDPC aims to balance the need to protect individuals’ personal data and the needs of organisations to use the data for legitimate purposes.

To achieve this aim, the PDPC formulates and implements policies relating to the protection of personal data, including the relevant regulations and Advisory Guidelines, to help organisations understand and comply with the PDPA.

The PDPC will also review organisational actions in relation to data protection rules and issue decisions or directions for compliance where necessary. As the PDPA is a baseline legislation, the PDPC will work with relevant sector regulators in exercising its functions. 

Beyond regulating data protection issues, the PDPC also undertakes public and sector-specific educational and outreach activities to help organisations adopt good data protection practices and to help individuals to better understand how they may protect their own personal data from misuse. 

In addition, the PDPC oversees the development and operation of the Do Not Call (DNC) Registry, to ensure that individuals receive only telemarketing messages they want, and to help organisations boost customer relations by increasing consumer confidence and trust.

### **Leadership Team**
The PDPC leadership team is made up of:

**Mr Tan Kiat How**<br>
Commissioner

**Mr Leong Keng Thai**<br>
Executive Chairman (DPAC)

**Mr Yeong Zee Kin**<br>
Deputy Commissioner
