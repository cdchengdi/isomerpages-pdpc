Organisations today collect, use and disclose personal data about individuals – whether they are customers, employees or members. These individuals trust organisations like yours to use or disclose their personal data as it is intended for and to keep their personal data safe. Practising good personal data management can increase business efficiency and effectiveness, boost customer confidence, and enhance your organisation’s public image.

Organisations in general are required to comply with the entire Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA). If your organisation has been contracted to process personal data on behalf of another organisation, your organisation may be considered a “data intermediary”. As a data intermediary processing personal data pursuant to a written contract, your organisation may be exempted from certain obligations in the PDPA and simply be responsible for protecting the personal data in your care and ensuring that the personal data is not kept by your organisation when there is no longer a business or legal need to do so.
