As part of advancing the digital economy strategy to allow Singapore to stand out as a trusted data hub with a well-developed data ecosystem that supports competition and innovation as well as the cross border data flow, the PDPC has developed the Data Protection Trustmark (DPTM) Certification to help organisations verify their conformance to personal data protection standards and best practices.

The DPTM will be a visible indicator that an organisation adopts sound data protection practices.

The certification scheme is administered by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). For more information on the certification and how to apply, please visit the [IMDA website](https://www.imda.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}.
