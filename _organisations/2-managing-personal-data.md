### **Step 1 - Appoint a Data Protection Officer**

Designate at least one person to develop your organisation’s personal data policies and oversee your organisation's compliance with the PDPA. This person may be an existing employee in your organisation, and his or her role may include the following:

* Developing good policies for handling personal data in electronic and/or manual form, that suit your organisation’s needs and comply with the PDPA;
* Communicating the internal personal data protection policies and processes to customers, members and employees;
* Handling queries or complaints about personal data from customers, members and employees;
* Alerting your organisation to any risks that might arise with personal data; and
* Liaising with the PDPC, if necessary.
