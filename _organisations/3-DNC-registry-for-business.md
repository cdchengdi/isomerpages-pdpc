Starting from 2 January 2014, the Do Not Call (DNC) provisions under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) generally prohibits organisations from sending certain marketing messages (in the form of voice calls, text or fax messages) to Singapore telephone numbers, including mobile, fixed-line, residential and business numbers, registered with the DNC Registry.

Such marketing messages generally have one or more of the following purposes:

* Offer to supply, advertise or promote goods or services;
* Advertise/promote suppliers or prospective suppliers of goods or services; or
* Supply/advertise/promote land, interests in land or business/investment opportunities.
