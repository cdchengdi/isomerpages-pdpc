### **Application for Exemption from the Transfer Limitation Obligation**

* Section 26(1) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall not transfer any personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with requirements prescribed under the PDPA to ensure that organisations provide a standard of protection to personal data so transferred that is comparable to the protection under the PDPA.
* Section 26(2) of the PDPA provides that the PDPC may, on the application of any organisation, by notice in writing exempt the organisation from any requirement prescribed pursuant to section 26(1) in respect of any transfer of personal data by that organisation.
* An exemption granted under section 26(2) may be granted subject to such conditions as the PDPC may specify in writing and may be revoked at any time by the PDPC.

### **Application for Exemption from any provision under the PDPA**

* Pursuant to section 62 of the PDPA, the PDPC may, with the approval of the Minister, by order published in the Gazette, exempt any person or organisation or any class of persons or organisations from all or any of the provisions of this Act, subject to such terms or conditions as may be specified in the order.
