### **Introduction**

The Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) empowers the PDPC to investigate and enforce the Do Not Call (DNC) provisions.

The PDPA was enforced in phases. The provisions relating to the DNC Registry came into effect on 2 January 2014 and the provisions relating to the main data protection on 2 July 2014. After the transition period, the PDPC may conduct investigations – upon complaint or on its own accord – to determine whether an organisation is complying with the Act.

### **Enforcement of the Do Not Call Registry Provisions**

The aim of the DNC Registry is to reduce the number of unwanted telemarketing calls, marketing text messages and faxes. Registering your number on the registry does not stop non-telemarketing calls, text messages and faxes and some types of telemarketing calls, text messages and faxes, which may include:

* Calls, text messages and faxes from businesses to which you have given your consent to receive telemarketing calls, text messages and/or faxes;

* Calls, text messages and faxes solely to provide you with periodic updates on your account statement, to notify you of a change in the terms or features of your ongoing commercial relationship with them or otherwise, text or fax messages from organisations with whom you have an ongoing relationship, and the purpose of the text or fax message is related to the subject of the ongoing relationship;

* An individual acting in a personal or domestic capacity;

* An organisation which is delivering goods or services, including product updates or upgrades, that the recipient of the message is entitled to receive under the terms of a transaction that the recipient had previously entered into with the sender;

* An organisation which is facilitating, completing or confirming a transaction that the recipient of the message has previously agreed to enter into with the sender; and

* Public agencies promoting any programme carried out by any public agency which is not for commercial purpose.
